## About The Project

The motivation for this project was to be able to practice and implement what the Module 01: HTML, CSS, & Git taught me. I built from the original code to improve (refactor) the inclusion of proper accessibility standards for a marketing agency site, which in turn would better position the site in search engines like Google.

## User Story

- AS A marketing agency
- I WANT a codebase that follows accessibility standards
- SO THAT our own site is optimized for search engines

## Acceptance Criteria

- GIVEN a webpage meets accessibility standards

- WHEN I view the source code
- THEN I find semantic HTML elements

- WHEN I view the structure of the HTML elements
- THEN I find that the elements follow a logical structure independent of styling and positioning

- WHEN I view the icon and image elements
- THEN I find accessible alt attributes

- WHEN I view the heading attributes
- THEN they fall in sequential order

- WHEN I view the title element
- THEN I find a concise, descriptive title

## Problems Solved (Could this be usage section?)

 Some of the refactoring done include the following:  

- the use of semantic HTML elements and logical/sequential structure of them
- making my images meet accessibility standards by adding alt attributes
- improved SEO of the site by adding a descriptive title element
- properly commented and consolidated css style selectors and properties
