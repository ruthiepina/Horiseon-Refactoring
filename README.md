# <Horiseon-Refactoring>

## Description

The motivation for this project was to be able to practice and implement what the Module 01: HTML, CSS, & Git taught me. I built from the original project to improve (refactor) the inclusion of proper accessibility standards for a marketing agency site, which in turn would better position the site in search engines like Google. Some of the refactoring done include:  

- the use of semantic HTML elements and logical/sequential structure of them
- making my images meet accessibility standards by adding alt attributes
- improved SEO of the site by adding a descriptive title element
- properly commented and consolidated css style selectors and properties
